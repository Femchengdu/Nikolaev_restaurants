### Nikolaiv City Map
This is a Javascript application listing the places I hope to be able to visit in the city of Nikolaiv Ukraine.

I have included my Here Maps keys for the purpose of demostration, but will deactivate the app account after the review of this project.

My implimentation of this app with Javascript was based on my understanding of the documentation from both Here Map API and Google Map API.
I found this to be the most straight forward approach since there were detailed examples I could follow and modify to my needs.


This application makes use of the following technoligies.
- KnockoutJs
- CSS
- HTML
- Node for installing Yarn
- Yarn for dependency tracking.
- Google Maps Api for map for geo coordinates.
- Here Maps Api for location address information.

#### Installation
To get this project working on your local machine, you would need to have node installed on your local machine. This is necessary to load the app's dependency (KnockoutJs) using Yarn.

Clone the reopsitory and cd into the main folder. Open the file named index.html in your browser and enjoy.
